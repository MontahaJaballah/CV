            <h3>IEEE: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers</h3>
            <p>At IEEE, I embarked on an enriching journey, immersing myself in diverse technical pursuits. My involvement spanned across the 
            Computer Society (CS), Robotics and Automation Society (RAS), and the Women in Engineering (WIE) chapters. This engagement allowed 
            me to delve into cutting-edge technologies, collaborate on innovative projects, and foster connections within a vibrant community of 
            like-minded individuals. Participating in events, workshops, and discussions at IEEE broadened
            my horizons, nurturing both my technical acumen and my passion for advancing technology in collaboration with talented peers.</p>
